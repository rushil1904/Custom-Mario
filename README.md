# Custom Mario

This is a custom mario game. The elements are customised to celebrate my friend's birthday. You can use this to create your own custom game or maybe contribute to this project to make it better. 

*The game works best on Chrome/ Chromium-based browsers.*

### Potential improvements 

You can help improve the game by making contributions. These can be: 
1. Addition of background music
2. Independent creation of enemy objects which move back and forth only on their specific platforms
3. Limit of one/two upper taps for the player

Thanks to [Chris Courses](https://youtu.be/4q2vvZn5aoo) for the initial setup.
